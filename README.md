      Fedora/CentOS packaging for ipcalc.

## About

This is the Fedora/CentOS packaging for [ipcalc](http://jodies.de/ipcalc) based on the original spec created by [atim](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim).

The binary was renamed `ipcalc-jodies` as not to conflict with the other [package of the same name](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/ipcalc) from the official Fedora repo.

## Builds

Builds are available on my Copr at https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/losuler/ipcalc-jodies.

This repo can be added on all supported systems by:

```bash
dnf copr enable losuler/ipcalc-jodies
```
